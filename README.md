This project as part of a school project for COEN353- Databases. 
The primary goal of the project was to design and set-up a database for a company that owns a network of dental clinics. An ER diagram ws created to represent the conceptual database schema for the application in which various constaints such as keys, functional dependencies, cardinality of the relationships were identified and marked. Finally the ER diagram was converted into a realtional database schema. 

A web-site for the application was set-up to perform basic CRUD operations on the database using PHP.
